I'm a software engineer and currently deal with mostly JavaScript. Besides JavaScripts flaws, I enjoy writing it because it gives plenty of freedom in how I want to design a solution. This allows me to be more creative and expressive when solving a problem, making it a very powerful tool. Another language I enjoy programming in is C#, it has a great balance of being flexible with a defined structure.

When creating a new application I follow TDD techniques to ensure the quality and reliability during construction.

I currently enjoy building hybrid mobile apps using the Ionic framework and cordova. Ionic has dealt with a lot of the UI pains to make it feel native and it is a pleasure to use.

Even though I don't actually design the web apps I do enjoy participating in the UI development, to help gain an understanding of how a user might interact with the app. I believe it's important to deliver a quality user experience and it is aesthetically pleasing.

Technologies that I have used and have good experience with are:

*   JavaScript
*   JavaScript frameworks:
	*   Angular
	*   React
	*   Backbone
	*   jQuery
	*   D3js

*   NodeJS
*   AJAX
*   C#
*   MVC.NET
*   PHP – OOP
