### Why have a delivery pipeline?

Generally a delivery pipeline gives you confidence that your app is functioning as you expect it and preventing regression. Including a delivery step will help reduce the over head of remembering the commands to run to release into production. However, there is a lot more about the importance of having a pipeline, you can read more from my post on [CI and continuous delivery (CD)](/continuous-integration-delivery-deployment)

### What I like Azure pipeline

As far as Azure pipelines are concerned I thought it would be worth trying to see how well it worked and the benefits of using it.

- It's free and you get a lot of good features for the free tier
- You can provide a configured yaml file which manages a good variety of steps. This allows you to version control your pipeline, which is always handy.
- The pipeline UI is clean and simple to navigate
- You can construct the pipeline in the UI with a load of predefined tasks then copy the yaml out to your project.
- I found the pipeline configuration really flexible which in a way is good/bad
- Lots of documentation about specific features and a few get started tutorials which I found handy.
