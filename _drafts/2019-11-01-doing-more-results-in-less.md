  Managing many tasks in your scrum board will result in less done

Typically speed of delivery is a key measure for an Agile software engineering teams but sometimes you notice a pattern that some weeks you end with high or low points. This affects how predictable your delivery is, so how can you make delivery more consistent for a delivery team?

This post will focus more on pace of delivery and around the teams processes. It won't cover tooling to reduce overheads, like automation. The reason you want to achieve predictable delivery, is so that a team can confidently estimate what can be done in a sprint. This can also help product and business estimate how long a feature could take to deliver.

I appreciate there are many things which affect pace of delivery however I would like to focus on this one.

## Limit work in progress (WIP)

Keep benefits of limiting <abbr title="Work in progress">WIP</abbr>:

- Focus on delivering items closest do "Done"
- Promote better communication to unblock tasks
- Create an improved team mentality to support the team objective
- Identify/highlight issues in the delivery flow
- Improve the quality of work delivered

### Setup limiting WIP

Lets start with some context, tasks move left to right through different states on a board which contains the following columns **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Review** and **Done**. The <abbr title="Work in progress">WIP</abbr> columns are **In Progress** and **Review**. How do you determine the limit? This should be agreed among the team but I would recommend limiting to the number by team members plus one or if you pair program, the number of pairs plus one. When a ticket moves to review that pair should check if there are any work items they can be reviewed, if none then start a new ticket.

### How does limiting WIP achieve these points?

What happens if WIP is at maximum, because for a team of four which pair programs has a limit of three, two items from a pair are in review. How do you move forward without breaking the rule? The pair, now effectively blocked, should encourage the others to have a look as soon as possible by stopping their work. This is disruptive, but the point here is to be supportive of each other to achieve the sprint. The benefit is if there are any review actions to take it can be dealt with the straight a way and moved to done sooner. Another issue this addresses is, the longer a ticket stays in review the less the original pair will remember their reasoning.

In the situation the WIP limit rule is not followed you could end up with more than one ticket which nobody is working on resulting in constant context switching. You might notice checklists to keep track but this is an overhead that can confuse and slow things down. A feature could be split into several tickets and they are all in WIP might end up with the feature delivered under one of those tickets for convenience. Resulting in making it difficult to track changes for the individual ticket.

Ultimately limiting WIP we will prevent several items in progress and improve the quality of work delivered.

If the WIP limit causes blocking regularly this highlights a potential issue in the flow. This should be brought up in retro to identify what could be causing the issue, maybe there is a big disparity between ticket complexity.
