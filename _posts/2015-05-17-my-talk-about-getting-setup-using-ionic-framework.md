 Meetup talk about Ionic Framework at ShoreditchJS.
---

I gave a talk at [ShoreditchJS meetup][1] about how to get started with Ionic framework for Android on Windows and&nbsp;Mac OS.

I thought it would be useful to give the talk to share parts I got stuck on when setting up and hopefully reduce the pain for others getting started.

Here are [my slides for the talk][2].
