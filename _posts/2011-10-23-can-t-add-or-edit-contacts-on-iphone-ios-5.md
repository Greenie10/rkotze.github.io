 Can't add or edit contacts on iPhone after upgrading to iOS 5.
---

If you have recently upgraded to the new iOS 5 and opted to use the iCloud you might have noticed that you can no longer add or edit your contacts. If you are one of these people the fix is quite simple but some what annoying.

###  The fix

* Go to Settings -&gt; iCloud and turn on Contacts. It will merge with iCloud.
* You should be able to go back to your contact list and see the add and edit button are back.
* If it works you can turn if off and you will still have the add and edit button.

This might be a bug but its a very strange one. Why do you need to sync your contacts with the iCloud to get the add and edit contact buttons back? After turning it on and then off again why do the buttons stay?
