 Join strings easily by removing the repetitive `falsy` checks. Joining classNames in React js.

**What is Joinable:** A library to join strings together without the need to check if a value is a falsy like `undefined`.

**Why use it:** Keep your code base clean by removing the if else statements and improve the readability.

Joinable API in the readme on [Github](https://github.com/rkotze/joinable){:target="_blank"} and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joinable){:target="_blank"}

<!--more-->

In situations where you need to concat a string to form a message based on some input, you typically create logic to construct it. You might find that you repeat an `if` checking values are not a falsy. Joinable removes this from the function body and help towards readability. Joinable can be used for more than building messages see below for another [example](#example-problem).

With Joinable it should be easy to construct strings like form validation messages, CSS classes, URLs and more.

### What does it look like?

ES6 example
{% highlight javascript %}
import joinable from 'joinable';

let myString = joinable('potato', null, 'rice', undefined, 'carrot'); // => 'potato rice carrot'
{% endhighlight %}

**Falsies handled:** `false, 0, "", undefined, null, NaN`

## Example joining classNames in ReactJs with logic

### Problem

Example of typical logic string concatenation in _ReactJS component_ with if statements. General issues: verbose, unnecessary repetitive complexity and mutation:

{% highlight javascript %}
const MyComponent = ({ children, className, hide }) => {
  let myClass = 'potato ';
  if(hide)
    myClass += 'invisible';

  if(className)
    myClass += className;

  return (
    <div className={myClass}>{children}</div>
  );
}

render(<MyComponent className="cucumber">Hello world</MyComponent>); 
// => <div class="potato cucumber">Hello world</div>
render(<MyComponent className="cucumber" hide>Hello world</MyComponent>); 
// => <div class="potato invisible cucumber">Hello world</div>
render(<MyComponent>Hello world</MyComponent>); 
// => <div class="potato undefined">Hello world</div>
{% endhighlight %}

While this works fine you will probably need to repeat that similar flow for a lot of components and some will have additional complexity round it.

### Joinable solution

Lets hide that logic away and keep it clean with `joinable`.

{% highlight javascript %}
const MyComponent = ({ children, className, hide }) => {
  const myClass = joinable('potato', className, [hide, 'invisible']);
  return (
    <div className={myClass}>
    {children}
    </div>
  );
}

render(<MyComponent className="cucumber">Hello world</MyComponent>); 
// => <div class="potato cucumber">Hello world</div>
render(<MyComponent className="cucumber" hide>Hello world</MyComponent>); 
// => <div class="potato invisible cucumber">Hello world</div>
render(<MyComponent>Hello world</MyComponent>); 
// => <div class="potato">Hello world</div>
{% endhighlight %}

### If else

Adding a conditional check in Joinable is easy with an **Array structure** and a length of **two** or **three**.

{% highlight javascript %}
const condition = variableA === variableB; // let's assume it's true
const myString = joinable('one', [condition, 'plus', 'minus'], 'one'); // => one plus one
{% endhighlight %}

### Customisable separator

Joinable allows you to change the separator default of **space**, helping you to solve other joinString challenges:

Example of building a URL:
{% highlight javascript %}
const url = joinable('http://www.richardkotze.com', 'projects', 'joinable', { separator: '/' });
console.log(url); // => http://www.richardkotze.com/projects/joinable
{% endhighlight %}

### Performance focused

I've put effort into ensuring Joinable has good performance and has been great learning.

Things that I found made significant gains was:

* Removing the need to use Array `slice`.
* Checking for joinable types `string` and `number` early.
* Using `continue` if value is a falsy.
* In `joinIf` function using plain `if` statements instead of spread operator and slice to run conditional array.

If you're interested you can clone the repo and run the benchmark tests `npm run benchmark`.
